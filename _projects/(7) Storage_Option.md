description: "The project focuses on the Gibson-Schwartz model as a foundational framework for stochastic modeling and calibration in the pricing of derivatives, particularly in the commodity markets. Following the calibration of the interest rate, the project proceeds to price the storage option, employing the adjusted model to quantify the value of holding storage assets in relation to the underlying commodity prices."
