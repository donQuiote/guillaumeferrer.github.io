description: "This study investigates the potential for predicting Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) using spacecraft housekeeping data. The research utilizes machine learning methods—including Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and SVM. Due to the lack of sufficient temporal resolution of the data for reliable predictions we had to build a proof of concept (PoC) showing the viability of our methods assuming higher EDAC rates."
