description: "This study investigates the potential for predicting Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) using spacecraft housekeeping data, particularly focusing on Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) counts. The research utilizes machine learning methods—including Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines—linking EDAC variations to CME-induced Forbush Decreases. Despite attempts to improve model performance, challenges arose due to the low frequency of EDAC events compared to CME durations, revealing that the EDAC data lacks the necessary temporal resolution for reliable predictions. The proof of concept (PoC) showed improved performance with assumed higher EDAC rates, highlighting that the EDAC data's quality limits practical CME prediction, suggesting a need for additional data sources to enhance model reliability."

This report investigates 212 firm characteristics proposed by Chen and Zimmermann in their paper on Open Source Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing. We aim to find a concise subset of these characteristics that effectively describes stock returns. In order to run machine learning methods, we applied thorough data preprocessing to eliminate highly correlated predictors and used data fitting algorithms to address the high density of missing values. The methods used include Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), Bootstrapped-Enhanced Lasso, Bootstrapped-Enhanced Elastic Net, and Nonparametric Estimation. For each method, we described the implementation process, results, and limitations. Each model successfully reduces the number of predictors, we assessed the quality of these subsets using a deep neural network, it achieves an out of sample accuracy of 52.96% .
