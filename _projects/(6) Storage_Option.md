description: "The project focuses on the Gibson-Schwartz model as a foundational framework for stochastic modeling and calibration in the pricing of derivatives, particularly in the commodity markets. Following the calibration of the interest rate, the project proceeds to price the storage option, employing the adjusted model to quantify the value of holding storage assets in relation to the underlying commodity prices."

This report investigates 212 firm characteristics proposed by Chen and Zimmermann in their paper on Open Source Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing. We aim to find a concise subset of these characteristics that effectively describes stock returns. In order to run machine learning methods, we applied thorough data preprocessing to eliminate highly correlated predictors and used data fitting algorithms to address the high density of missing values. The methods used include Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), Bootstrapped-Enhanced Lasso, Bootstrapped-Enhanced Elastic Net, and Nonparametric Estimation. For each method, we described the implementation process, results, and limitations. Each model successfully reduces the number of predictors, we assessed the quality of these subsets using a deep neural network, it achieves an out of sample accuracy of 52.96% .
