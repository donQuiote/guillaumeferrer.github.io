description: "In recent years, the proliferation of toxic speech on the Internet has triggered the need for new tools of systematic detection. Deep learning (DL) models are often the privileged choice to address the problem. However, they fails to provide good performance when strictly talking about hate speech and, as Large Language Model, their large memory usage create speed issues during inference, indeed all parameters are used when it might not be necessary.
In this paper, we present an architecture aiming to improve state of the art hate speech detection model HateBERT by having faster inference and at least similar results. The architecture consists of a classifier sending sentences to one of eleven distilled hate speech detectors based on the hate speech target. While the model fails to obtain good performance overall due to the first classifier, good specification of students models indicate an interesting way to follow for further research."
