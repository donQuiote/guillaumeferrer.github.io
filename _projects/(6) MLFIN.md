We investigated 212 firm characteristics and aimed to find a concise subset of these characteristics that effectively describes stock returns. In order to run machine learning methods, we applied thorough data preprocessing to eliminate highly correlated predictors and used data fitting algorithms to address the high density of missing values. We used methods such as Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), Bootstrapped-Enhanced Lasso, Bootstrapped-Enhanced Elastic Net, and Nonparametric Estimation in order to reduce the number of predictors. Once a subset was found, we built deep neural network for directional trading.
