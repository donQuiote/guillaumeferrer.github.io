description: "This report examines 212 firm characteristics to identify a concise subset that predicts stock returns. Using machine learning methods like SFFS, Bootstrapped-Enhanced Lasso, and Elastic Net, we preprocess data, eliminate correlations, and handle missing values. The selected features, are evaluated with a deep neural network which achieve an out-of-sample accuracy of 52.96%."

This report investigates 212 firm characteristics proposed by Chen and Zimmermann in their paper on Open Source Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing. We aim to find a concise subset of these characteristics that effectively describes stock returns. In order to run machine learning methods, we applied thorough data preprocessing to eliminate highly correlated predictors and used data fitting algorithms to address the high density of missing values. The methods used include Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS), Bootstrapped-Enhanced Lasso, Bootstrapped-Enhanced Elastic Net, and Nonparametric Estimation. For each method, we described the implementation process, results, and limitations. Each model successfully reduces the number of predictors, we assessed the quality of these subsets using a deep neural network, it achieves an out of sample accuracy of 52.96% .
