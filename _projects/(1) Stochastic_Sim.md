description: "Option pricing often relies on Monte Carlo simulations when analytical solutions arenâ€™t available. Importance Sampling (IS) addresses this issue by modifying the probability distribution used in the simulation, thereby reducing variance. In this project, we compare crude Monte Carlo with two IS-based methods: one that adaptively updates the probability measure to find the optimal change, and another that uses an optimal control formulation. Our goal is to show how IS can significantly lower variance, ultimately improving pricing accuracy."
