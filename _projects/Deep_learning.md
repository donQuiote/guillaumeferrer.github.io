description: "This report explores high-frequency financial big data, including order book and trading quotes for 87 stocks over five years, to design trading strategies targeting intra-day bubbles. These bubbles are identified using three criteria: price, volatility, and volume. The study aims to develop strategies to detect and exploit market inefficiencies to generate returns. Additionally, various hyper-parameters are tested to identify distinct market regimes. We eventually find changes in strategy performance over time, supporting the presence of regimes. We also find that volume-based strategies tend to provide better results."
